Simple rust program to backup files on a Windows system.

This was my first attempt at using the Rust programming language to develop
a simple utility program on the Windows platform. It provided me a way to 
begin to learn the language as well as create a program that I can use on my
primary Windows machine.

The coding is crude, but you have to crawl before you can walk. I hope that
others may find the program useful, and I would welcome input on how to make
the code more robust.

SourceDirectories.txt and SourceDirectoriesExclude.txt are provided as samples
and you would need to tailor them to your environment.
